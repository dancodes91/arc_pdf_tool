# Status Display Fix

## Issue
Frontend was showing "Failed" status even though uploads were successful.

## Root Cause
- **API returns:** `"status": "processed"`
- **Frontend expects:** `"status": "completed"`
- **Result:** Everything not "completed" or "processing" shows as "Failed"

## Fix Applied
Updated frontend to accept **both** "completed" and "processed" as successful statuses:

### Files Changed:
1. `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Dashboard table
2. `frontend/app/preview/[id]/page.tsx` - Preview page

### Changes:
```typescript
// Before:
book.status === 'completed'

// After:
book.status === 'completed' || book.status === 'processed'
```

## Result
After frontend restart, both statuses will show as green "Completed" âœ…

## To See Fix:
```bash
# Restart frontend (if not already done for CSS fix)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then refresh browser - status should now show "Completed" in green!
