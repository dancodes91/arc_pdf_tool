# ARC PDF Tool - Development Progress

## Week 1 - Day 1: Branch Setup & Architecture Foundation

### âœ… Completed
- **Branch Setup**: Created `alex-feature` branch and pushed to origin
- **Development Environment**:
  - Migrated to UV package manager for faster dependency resolution
  - Created modern pyproject.toml with all dependencies
  - Added .env.example for configuration management
  - Enhanced .gitignore with project-specific patterns
  - Added development tooling (Ruff, Black, MyPy, pytest)
- **Architecture Analysis**:
  - Confirmed existing MVP has complete normalized schema (8 tables)
  - Identified sophisticated parser base class with multi-method extraction
  - Found working Flask app with upload/preview/diff/export pipeline
- **Database Migration System**:
  - âœ… Set up Alembic for database migrations
  - âœ… Created initial migration from existing schema
  - âœ… Successfully migrated database with all 8 tables
  - âœ… Configured environment-based database URL
- **Shared Parser Utilities**:
  - âœ… Confidence scoring system with 4 levels (High, Medium, Low, Very Low)
  - âœ… Enhanced PDF I/O with PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, Camelot, OCR fallback
  - âœ… Data normalization for prices, SKUs, dates, finish codes, UOM
  - âœ… Provenance tracking for complete data lineage
  - âœ… Comprehensive test suite with 16 passing tests

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- **Phase 1 Foundation**: 98% complete (existing MVP + enhanced tooling)
- **Database Schema**: Fully normalized with migration system ready
- **Parser Framework**: Sophisticated base class ready for enhancement
- **Next Steps**: Build shared parser utilities with confidence scoring

### ðŸ“‹ Today's Plan
1. âœ… Branch setup and dev environment
2. âœ… Review and enhance database schema with Alembic migrations
3. âœ… Implement shared parser utilities with confidence scoring
4. ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**: Build SELECT Hinges parser with effective date + options extraction

### ðŸš€ Architecture Decisions Made
- **Database**: Keep PostgreSQL-ready SQLAlchemy models, add Alembic migrations
- **Parsing**: Enhance existing pdfplumber + Camelot + OCR pipeline
- **Framework**: Gradual Flask â†’ FastAPI migration (coexistence approach)
- **Tooling**: Modern Python stack with Ruff, Black, MyPy for code quality

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- Existing codebase is more mature than expected - sophisticated parser base class
- Database schema is already normalized and comprehensive
- Can build on solid foundation rather than starting from scratch
- Flask app structure is clean and can coexist with FastAPI during migration
