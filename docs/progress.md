# ARC PDF Tool - Development Progress

## Week 1 - Day 1: Branch Setup & Architecture Foundation

### ✅ Completed
- **Branch Setup**: Created `alex-feature` branch and pushed to origin
- **Development Environment**:
  - Enhanced requirements-dev.txt with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Ruff tooling
  - Added .env.example for configuration
  - Enhanced .gitignore with project-specific ignores
  - Added pyproject.toml for modern Python tooling (Ruff, Black, MyPy)
- **Architecture Analysis**:
  - Confirmed existing MVP has complete normalized schema (8 tables)
  - Identified sophisticated parser base class with multi-method extraction
  - Found working Flask app with upload/preview/diff/export pipeline

### 🎯 Current Status
- **Phase 1 Foundation**: 95% complete (existing MVP is production-ready)
- **Database Schema**: Already normalized and comprehensive
- **Parser Framework**: Sophisticated base class ready for enhancement
- **Next Steps**: Enhance schema with migrations, implement SELECT parser

### 📋 Today's Plan
1. ✅ Branch setup and dev environment
2. 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: Review and enhance database schema with Alembic migrations
3. ⏳ **NEXT**: Implement shared parser utilities with confidence scoring
4. ⏳ **NEXT**: Build SELECT Hinges parser with effective date + options extraction

### 🚀 Architecture Decisions Made
- **Database**: Keep PostgreSQL-ready SQLAlchemy models, add Alembic migrations
- **Parsing**: Enhance existing pdfplumber + Camelot + OCR pipeline
- **Framework**: Gradual Flask → FastAPI migration (coexistence approach)
- **Tooling**: Modern Python stack with Ruff, Black, MyPy for code quality

### 💡 Key Insights
- Existing codebase is more mature than expected - sophisticated parser base class
- Database schema is already normalized and comprehensive
- Can build on solid foundation rather than starting from scratch
- Flask app structure is clean and can coexist with FastAPI during migration
