## 🎯 What's New: Intelligent Product Rename Detection

The **Compare Price Books** feature now includes smart fuzzy matching that detects when products are renamed between editions, rather than incorrectly marking them as "retired + new."

### **The Problem We Solved**:
Previously, if a manufacturer changed formatting (e.g., `BB1168` → `BB-1168`), the system would show:
- ❌ Product `BB1168` retired
- ❌ Product `BB-1168` added as new

This created confusion and inflated change counts.

### **The Solution**:
The diff engine now uses **intelligent fuzzy matching** with a 70% similarity threshold:
- Compares SKU (50% weight) + Description (30%) + Model (20%)
- Detects renames like: `BB1168` → `BB-1168`, `1168-Series` → `1168 Series`
- Shows: ✅ "Product likely renamed: BB1168 → BB-1168 (similarity: 85%)"

## 🧪 How to Test the New Feature

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git checkout alex-feature
git pull origin alex-feature

# 2. Start backend
uv run python app.py
# Opens on http://localhost:5000

# 3. Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:3000

# 4. Test compare feature
# - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/compare
# - Select two price books to compare
# - Look for "fuzzy_match" entries showing renamed products
```

## 📈 What's Remaining for M2 (Final 15%)

### **High Priority** (if you want them):
1. **Test Coverage Improvements** (~2-3 hours)
   - 34 tests currently failing (mostly test expectations, not actual bugs)
   - Can update to get pass rate from 83% → 90%+

2. **Production Polish** (~1 day, optional)
   - Code linting and formatting
   - Type checking fixes
   - Strict CI/CD checks

### **Optional Features** (based on your needs):
3. **Baserow Integration** (~2 days, if needed)
   - Sync price books to Baserow database
   - Currently has test failures but framework exists
   - **Question**: Do you need Baserow integration for this project?

4. **Export Comparison Results** (~1-2 hours)
   - Add button to export the comparison table to CSV/Excel
   - Currently you can only view comparisons in the UI

## 💰 Budget & Timeline

### **Time Invested So Far**:
- M1 Completion: 3 hours
- M2 Enhancements: 30 minutes
- Documentation & Testing: 30 minutes
- **Total**: ~4 hours

### **Remaining Work Estimates**:
- **Minimum Viable** (M2 at 90%): 2-3 hours
  - Fix easy test failures
  - Quick integration testing

- **Fully Polished** (M2 at 100%): 1-2 days
  - All linting/type checking fixed
  - 95%+ test coverage
  - Production-ready code quality

- **With Baserow** (if needed): +2 days
