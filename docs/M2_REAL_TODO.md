**Date**: October 2, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ALREADY COMPLETE (M2 Features Working)

- ‚úÖ `core/diff_engine_v2.py` - Advanced diff engine exists (fuzzy matching, rename detection)
- ‚úÖ `core/observability.py` - StructuredLogger with metrics tracking
- ‚úÖ `core/resilience.py` - Circuit breaker, retry logic, rate limiting
- ‚úÖ `core/exceptions.py` - Custom exception hierarchy
- ‚úÖ `core/tasks.py` - Celery task definitions
- ‚úÖ `core/database.py` - Database utilities
- ‚úÖ `integrations/baserow_client.py` - Baserow integration client

### Frontend Complete:
- ‚úÖ `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Dashboard UI
- ‚úÖ `frontend/app/upload/page.tsx` - Upload UI
- ‚úÖ `frontend/app/preview/[id]/page.tsx` - Preview with confidence meter ‚ú® (M1 completion)
- ‚úÖ `frontend/app/compare/page.tsx` - Compare UI (fully built!)
- ‚úÖ `frontend/lib/stores/priceBookStore.ts` - State management with compare function

### API Complete:
- ‚úÖ `/api/upload` - Upload endpoint
- ‚úÖ `/api/export` - Export endpoint (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- ‚úÖ `/api/price-books` - List price books
- ‚úÖ `/api/products/:id` - Get products
- ‚úÖ `/api/compare` - Compare endpoint (EXISTS!)

---

## üî¥ WHAT'S MISSING OR BROKEN (Real M2 Work)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è BACKEND: Compare/Diff Integration Not Wired
**Issue**: Compare UI exists, but backend might not be using diff_engine_v2.py

**Files to Check/Fix**:
```python
# Check if app.py or api_routes.py uses diff_engine_v2
# Current: Probably uses old diff_engine.py
# Need: Wire up core/diff_engine_v2.py with fuzzy matching
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Check if `/api/compare` endpoint uses `diff_engine_v2.py` or old `diff_engine.py`
- [ ] If using old engine, migrate to `diff_engine_v2.py`
- [ ] Test fuzzy rename detection works in UI
- [ ] Test price change calculations
- [ ] Test new/retired product detection

**Effort**: 2-4 hours

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è TESTS: 34 Tests Failing (Real Issues)
**Current**: 166 passing, 34 failing

**Test Categories**:

#### A. **Baserow Integration Tests** (12 failing)
- StructuredLogger signature mismatch
- Natural key hash missing
- Async/await issues
- **Impact**: Baserow publishing doesn't work
- **Priority**: HIGH if client wants Baserow integration

#### B. **Diff Engine v2 Tests** (5 failing)
- Fuzzy matching threshold too strict
- Rename detection not working
- Rule change counting off
- **Impact**: Advanced compare features don't work
- **Priority**: HIGH (needed for compare page)

#### C. **Parser Tests** (7 failing)
- Test expectations don't match strict validation
- Expected 252 products, now get 99 (correct behavior)
- **Impact**: None - tests need updating, not code
- **Priority**: LOW (just update test expectations)

#### D. **Parser Hardening Tests** (8 failing)
- OCR edge cases
- Multi-row header welding
- Price normalization edge cases
- **Impact**: Edge case handling
- **Priority**: LOW (document as known limitations)

#### E. **Exception Handling Tests** (3 failing)
- Retry mechanism tests
- Performance tracker tests
- **Impact**: Minor reliability features
- **Priority**: LOW

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Fix diff engine v2 tests (CRITICAL for compare page)
- [ ] Fix Baserow tests (only if client needs it)
- [ ] Update parser test expectations (easy wins)
- [ ] Document edge cases for hardening tests
- [ ] Fix exception handling tests (if time)

**Effort**: 2-3 days

---

### 3. üé® FRONTEND: Compare Page Backend Integration
**Issue**: Compare UI exists but needs testing with real backend

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Test compare page with 2 uploaded price books
- [ ] Verify diff results display correctly
- [ ] Check fuzzy matches show in UI
- [ ] Test price change percentages
- [ ] Test new/retired product indicators

**Files to Review**:
- `frontend/app/compare/page.tsx` - Already built!
- `frontend/lib/stores/priceBookStore.ts` - comparePriceBooks function exists
- API call goes to `/api/compare` - Need to verify backend

**Effort**: 1-2 hours testing

---

### 4. üìä MONITORING: Baserow Integration
**Issue**: Baserow client exists but has bugs preventing use

**Files**:
- `integrations/baserow_client.py` - Has async/await issues
- Tests: `tests/test_baserow_integration.py` - 12 failing

**Decision Point**: **Does the client actually want Baserow integration?**
- If YES: Fix all 12 tests (2 days work)
- If NO: Document as "available but not production-ready"

**Action Items** (only if needed):
- [ ] Fix StructuredLogger calls
- [ ] Add natural key hash generation
- [ ] Fix async/await patterns
- [ ] Test circuit breaker
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Document Baserow setup

**Effort**: 1.5-2 days (ONLY if client needs it)

---

### 5. üêõ CI/CD: Linting & Type Checking
**Current**: CI passes but with warnings (we made it lenient)

**Action Items** (for production polish):
- [ ] Run `ruff check .` and fix issues
- [ ] Run `black --check .` and format code
- [ ] Run `mypy` and fix type issues
- [ ] Enable strict CI again

**Effort**: 1 day (can be done anytime)

---

### 6. üîç OPTIONAL: Advanced Features
**Nice-to-Have Features**:

#### A. **Batch Upload**
- Upload multiple PDFs at once
- Show progress for each file
- **UI**: Add to upload page
- **Backend**: Celery tasks already exist!
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours

#### B. **Export Comparison Results**
- Export diff table to CSV/Excel
- Currently can only view in UI
- **Backend**: Use export_manager.py
- **Frontend**: Add export button to compare page
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours

#### C. **Search/Filter on Preview Page**
- Already has filters, but could add:
  - Search by finish code
  - Filter by price range (already exists!)
  - Sort by various columns
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED M2 WORK PLAN

### **Priority 1: Make Compare Page Work** (1 day)
This is the BIGGEST gap - compare UI exists but needs working backend.

**Day 1 Tasks**:
1. [ ] Check if `/api/compare` uses `diff_engine_v2.py` (30 min)
2. [ ] If not, wire up diff_engine_v2 (2 hours)
3. [ ] Fix 5 diff engine v2 tests (3 hours)
4. [ ] Test compare page end-to-end (1 hour)
5. [ ] Fix any UI issues found (1 hour)

**Success**: Compare page fully functional with fuzzy matching

---

### **Priority 2: Fix Easy Test Failures** (0.5 day)
Get test pass rate from 83% ‚Üí 90%+

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Update parser test expectations (7 tests) - 2 hours
2. [ ] Fix exception handling tests (3 tests) - 2 hours

**Success**: 176/200 tests passing (88%)

---

### **Priority 3: Baserow Integration** (Only if Client Needs It)
**Decision Required**: Ask Shane if Baserow integration is needed.

- If YES: Allocate 2 days to fix all 12 tests
- If NO: Document as "not production-ready" and move on

---

### **Priority 4: Production Polish** (1 day)
Clean up for production deployment.

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Run linting and fix issues - 2 hours
2. [ ] Run black and format code - 1 hour
3. [ ] Fix type checking issues - 2 hours
4. [ ] Enable strict CI - 1 hour
5. [ ] Document known limitations - 1 hour

**Success**: CI fully green, code production-ready

---

### **Priority 5: Optional Enhancements** (If Time/Budget)
Add nice-to-have features.

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Export comparison results - 2 hours
2. [ ] Batch upload UI - 3 hours
3. [ ] Advanced search/filter - 2 hours

---

### **Minimum Viable M2** (1.5 days)
- Fix compare page backend (1 day)
- Fix easy tests (0.5 day)
- **Result**: Core features working, 90% test pass

### **Full M2 Without Baserow** (3 days)
- Fix compare page (1 day)
- Fix tests (0.5 day)
- Production polish (1 day)
- Optional enhancements (0.5 day)
- **Result**: Production-ready, all features working

### **Full M2 With Baserow** (5 days)
- All above PLUS:
- Fix Baserow integration (2 days)
- **Result**: Production-ready with Baserow

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Step 1: Verify Compare Backend** (START HERE)
```bash
# Check if compare endpoint uses new diff engine
grep -r "diff_engine_v2" app.py api_routes.py

# Check what the compare endpoint actually does
grep -A 20 "@api.route('/compare')" api_routes.py

# Test the compare endpoint manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/compare \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"old_price_book_id": 1, "new_price_book_id": 2}'
```

### **Step 2: Test Compare UI**
```bash
# Make sure backend is running
uv run python app.py

# Make sure frontend is running
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:3000/compare

# Upload 2 price books and try comparing
```

### **Step 3: Fix What's Broken**
Based on testing results, fix the actual issues found.
